# Logging

Here I followed [Logging in Python](https://realpython.com/courses/logging-python/)
course from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/). This goes through the details of
the logger library in python. To follow my ramblings look at the files in the following
order:

- root_logger.py
- custom_logger.py
- import_logger.py
- conf_logger.py
- yaml_logger.py
